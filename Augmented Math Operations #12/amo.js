/* Augmented Math Operations */

// Compound Assignment with Augmented Addition:
var a = 3; // Current value of 'a' is: 3
var b = 17; // Current value of 'b' is: 17
var c = 12; // Current value of 'c' is: 12

a = a + 12; // Results: Current value of 'a' is '15' because 'a + 12' is like '3 + 12' (3 is the value the 'a' variable above holds)

// Instead of doing it this way there's a faster way to do it like: 'a += 12' Which is the same as doing this 'a = a + 12'

b += 9; // Current value of 'b' is: 26
c += 7; // Current value of 'c' is: 19


// Compound Assignment with Augmented Subtraction:

var d = 11; // Current value of 'd' is: 11
var e = 9; // Current value of 'e' is: 9
var f = 3; // current value of 'f' is: 3

d = d - 6; // Results: Current value of 'd' is '5' because 'd - 6' is like '11 - 6' (11 is the value the 'd' variable above holds)

// Instead of doing it this way there's a faster way to do it like: 'd -= 6' Which is the same as doing this 'd = d - 6'

e -= 15; // Current value of 'e' is: 6
f -= 1; // Current value of 'f' is: 2


// Compound Assignment with Augmented Multiplication:

var g = 5; // Current value of 'g' is: 5
var h = 12; // Current value of 'h' is: 12
var i = 4.6; // Current value of 'i' is: 4.6

g = g * 5; // Results: Current value of 'g' is '25' because 'g * 5' is like '5 * 5' (5 is the value the 'g' variable above holds)

// Instead of doing it this way there's a faster way to do it like: 'g *= 5' Which is the same as doing this 'g = g * 5'

h *= 12; // Current value of 'h' is: 144
i *= 4.6; // Current value of 'i' is: 21.16


// Compound Assignment with Augmented Division:

var j = 48; // Current value of 'j' is: 48
var k = 108; // Current value of 'k' is: 108
var l = 33; // Current value of 'l' is: 33

j = j / 12; // Results: Current value of 'j' is '4' because 'j / 12' is like '48 / 12' (48 is the value the 'j' variable above holds)

// Instead of doing it this way there's a faster way to do it like: 'j /= 12' Which is the same as doing this 'j = j / 12'

k /= 4; // Current value of 'k' is: 108
l /= 11; // Current value of 'l' is: 3
