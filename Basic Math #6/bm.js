/* Basic Math */


// Addition
var sum = 10 + 10; // Current value is: 20 (That's because '10 + 10 = 20' just like in math)
console.log(sum); // Logs to the browser console the value of 'sum' variable which is: 20


// Subtraction
var difference = 45 - 33; // Current value is: 12 (That's because '45 - 33 = 12' just like in math)
console.log(difference); // Logs to the browser console the value of 'difference' variable which is: 12


// Multiplication
var product = 8 * 10; // Current value is: 80 (That's because '8 * 10 = 80' just like in math)
console.log(product); // Logs to the browser console the value of 'product' variable which is: 80


// Division
var quotinent = 66 / 33; // Current value is: 2 (That's because '66 / 33 = 2' just like in math)
console.log(quotinent); // Logs to the browser console the value of 'quotinent' variable which is: 2
