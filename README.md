# JavaScript Notes By: SillyBilly0069

These are all the notes with explanations made by me (According to my understanding, there could be mistakes. If you can explain it in a better way or have things to add then please do) from a course called **(Learn JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners by: freeCodeCamp)** **Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg&t=4627s

Everything is put into folders because of their long names (Couldn't name the file names really long because it would look bad) as well as numbers at the end of each folder to let you know the sorting and from where it starts and from where it ends (1-119)

If you are able to spot any typos change them and if you can add more simple explanations or add more notes to any of the files, please do so. Thank you!
