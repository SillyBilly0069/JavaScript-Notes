/* Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator */


// Initialize these three variables

var a = 5; // Current value of 'a' is: 5
var b = 10; // Current value of 'b' is: 10
var c = "I am a"; // Current value of 'c' is: "I am a"

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1; // Results: Current value of 'a' is '6' because 'a + 1' is like '5 + 1' (5 is the value the 'a' variable above holds)
b = b + 1; // Results: Current value of 'b' is '15' because 'b + 5' is like '10 + 5' (10 is the value the 'b' variable above holds)
c = c + " String!"; // Results: Current value of 'c' is 'I am a String!' (The 'c' value above concatenates with the new 'c' value because it's 'c' + " String!" Therefore the results is: 'I am a String!')
