/* Incrementing and Decrementing */

/* To increment a number means to add 1 to it */


var myVar = 87; // Current value is: 87

myVar = myVar + 1; // Results: 88 reason for that is because the value of 'myVar' above is '87' and '87 + 1 = 88'

// Instead of the code above you could increment in a faster way without using the variable name like this:
myVar++; // Current value is: 89 because the variable 'myVar' in the line 6 is '87' then the value of 'myVar' on the line 8 becomes '88' and on this line the current value is '88 + 1 = 89'

var mySecondVar = 11; // Current value is: 11

mySecondVar = mySecondVar - 1; // Results: 10 reason for that is because the value of 'mySecondVar' above is '11' and '11 - 1 = 10'

// Instead of the code above you could decrement in a faster way without using the variable name like this:
mySecondVar--; // Current value is: 9 because the variable 'mySecondVar' in the line 13 is '11' then the value of 'mySecondVar' on the line 15 becomes '10' and on this line the current value is '10 - 1 = 9'
