/* Data Types and Variables */

/* JavaScript provides 7 different data types that you can use within JavaScript */

/* Data Types:
undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object
*/


/* undefined = something that hasn't been defined
Example: A variable without any value/no value assigned to it
*/


/* 
null = nothing

Example: You've set it to be something and that thing is nothing aka this is null or nothing
*/


/* boolean = true or false or in other words yes or no */


/*
string = simple text written within quotes

Example:
"This is a string"
'This is also a string'

Anything between "double quotes" or 'single quotes' is a string
*/


/* symbol = an immutable primitive value that is unique */


/* number = number (16123846) */


/* object = an object can store a lot of different key value pairs */


/*
