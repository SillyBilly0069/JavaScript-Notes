/* Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings */

var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string aside \"double quotes\""; // Current value of 'myStr' is: I am a "double quoted" string aside "double quotes" (Type: String)

// By using the escape character '\' JavaScript no longer interprets as being the last character in the string.
