/* Build JavaScript Objects */

// Objects are similar to arrays except that instead of using indexes to access data, you use properties.

// Properties are anything that is behind the colon ":" and the values are anything that is after the colon while the comma "," is the property separator

var ourDog = {
    "name": "Camper", // Property 'name' with a value of: Camper
    "legs": 4, // Property 'legs' with a value of: 4
    "tails": 1, // Property 'tails' with a value of: 1
    "friends": ["everything!"] // Property 'friends' with a value of: ["everything!"]
};

var myDog = {
    "name": "Quincy", // Property 'name' with a value of: Quincy
    "legs": 3, // Property 'legs' with a value of: 3
    "tails": 2, // Property 'tails' with a value of: 2
    "friends": [] // Property 'friends' with a value of: []
};
